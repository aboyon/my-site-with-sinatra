  title: Some things I want to say...
  body: !!html
    <h4>Why Sinatra?</h4>
        <p>
          Because is an easy and light Ruby framework. Easy to use, and easy to extend. And mainly... because is much better than Silex
        </p>
        <h4>Why Ruby?</h4>
        <p>
          PHP is not a challenge for Ruby. Honestly, Ruby is far away much better than PHP. If JAVA is a Lego and Ruby is Play doh, I don't know what is PHP compared with them. I'm very thankful to PHP for all the jobs, and the chance to learn lot of things around the development, but honestly, there is no way back to PHP in my life.

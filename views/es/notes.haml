  As I mentioned in the home page, I am married since 2004, I have two beautiful daugthers,
  I'm
  %a(href='http://www.wol.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2016/02/SoF-9-2015-1.pdf' target='_blank') Christian guy
  and I like Running (and sometimes... a little bit of Crossfit).

  Programming is something I really like to do, even more when I get paid for that :). I have been in this industry since I was 20 years old, hence, I collected almost 19 years of experience dealing with deadlines, startups, big clients, deliverables and.. HOTFIXES, so, even when I know that I am not a genius, when I commit with a project, I take it seriously, and I don't give up until the stuff get done. Even when it's something I don't like to do, I'm willing to "walk the extra mile" when worth it.

  Fortunately, life it's more than spend hours in front of the laptop, filling tickets, defining acceptance criterias, and creating pull requests. Thanks God there's a world to discover and a family to enjoy.
